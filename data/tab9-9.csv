The National Survey of College Graduates asks the degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do—an individual has in seeing (with glasses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, lifting 10 pounds, or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Respondents who answered ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" or ""unable to do"" for any activity were classified as having a disability. Scientists and engineers are individuals who have a bachelor's or higher degree, are living in the United States, and have an S&E or S&E-related degree or occupation. ",,,,,,,
